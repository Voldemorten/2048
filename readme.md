# A simple 2048
Created with JS (and jQuery).
Just open index.html to run.

Note a few bugs:
- You loose the game when all tiles are filled even though you can do something.
- If you "can't" move in a direction, you are still able to and a random tile is created.


Project created back in 2017 and just decided that it belonged on github ;-)
